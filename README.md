### Jia Zhang, zhan7164@umn.edu

Machine used for testing: **csel-lind40-02.cselabs.umn.edu**
(Also used personal computers.)

### Problems encountered
1. Producers are supposed to deposit 2000 items, so we let each producer deposit 2000 items, hoping that the homework is not requiring a total of 2000 items.
2. Program may take a little while to finish.
