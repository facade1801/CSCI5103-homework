## Using 1 Grace Day

### Ce Yao, yao00136@umn.edu
### Jia Zhang, zhan7164@umn.edu

Machine used for testing: **csel-lind40-02.cselabs.umn.edu**
(Also used personal macOS & Ubuntu 20.04 machines.)

### Problems encountered
1. Producers are supposed to deposit 2000 items, so we let each producer deposit 2000 items, which would sum up to 6000.
2. Program may take a little while to finish.
3. Sometimes it may stuck because of various reasons, but it shouldn't be the problem of the code itself, as we've run it countless times. If you meet any problems running it, please contact us. Thank you!
